# Surrealix

Lightweight, correct and up-to-date Elixir SDK for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/docs/integration/sdks).
The API is 100% code-generated and implements the Websocket protocol as documented here - [WebSocket (text protocol)](https://surrealdb.com/docs/integration/websocket/text).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `surrealix` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:surrealix, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/surrealix>.

## Aknowledgements

Code foundation was taken from https://github.com/joojscript/surrealdb_ex. Since this package has not received any commits in the last 7 months (2023-10-31) and the issues are left uncommented, I have assumed that the maintainer is not interested in any contributions.
